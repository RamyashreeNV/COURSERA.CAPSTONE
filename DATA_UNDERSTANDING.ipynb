    "Life is so busy in this 21st century and we all are often in fast-track!! Everybody rushes and always want to reach their destination in no time!! This hurry sometimes can be life threatening as accidents might happen. Now-a-days,  road accidents are very common and most of the times they lead to loss of property, injuries and can even cause death. So, wouldn’t it be great to try to understand the most common causes, in order to prevent them from happening?\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, not paying enough attention during driving, abusing drugs and alcohol or driving at very high speed are the main causes of occurring accidents that can be prevented by enacting harsher regulations. Besides this, weather, visibility, or road conditions are the major uncontrollable factors that can be prevented by revealing hidden patterns in the data and announcing warning to the local government, police and drivers on the targeted roads. In order to understand these common factors that are causing accidents and the correlation between them, I am attempting to analyze the data from City of Seattle’s police department showing all the collisions from 2004 till present. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an effort to reduce the frequency of car collisions, an algorithm must be developed to predict the severity of an accident given the current weather, road and visibility conditions. \n",
    "The model and its results are going to provide some advice for the target audience to make insightful decisions for reducing the number of accidents in the city. "

    "Data set from the Seattle Police Department has 37 independent variables with 194,673 records collected since 2004 to present. As the main objective of this project is to analyze the severity of the accidents, our dependent/target variable will be 'SEVERITYCODE' and the attributes we will be using to measure the severity of accidents are 'WEATHER', 'ROADCOND' and 'LIGHTCOND'. Our target variable 'SEVERITYCODE' consists of numbers 1 & 2 with 1 being only 'Property Damage Only Collision' and 2 is 'injury collision'.\n",

    "The ample amount of data collected from past 15 years can definitely be used for the analysis of the severity of accidents only after pre-processing or cleaning the Data. That is, in the collected dataset there are many irrelevant attributes that are not necessary for our analysis and can be dropped out from the data set.  "
